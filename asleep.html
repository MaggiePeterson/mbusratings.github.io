        Today's article is just a fun story about how my friend fell asleep on the MBus. <br>
               
	"One day when I was on the way to ENGR 100 on North Campus, the weather outside was cold and wet, and the nice warm 
        air in the bus along with the motion of the bus put me right to sleep. By the time I awoke, the bus was heading 
        towards the stadium and I realized I was no longer on Commuter North: I was on Commuter South. So, I rode the bus 
        down to the stadium where the bus driver exited, so I exited the bus along with him. When he reentered the bus after
        a bathroom break, he changed the bus to be Commuter North. I hopped back on and traveled farther and longer than I ever have before."

        Wow, what a story!
